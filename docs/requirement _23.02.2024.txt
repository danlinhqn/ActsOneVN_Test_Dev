Objective: Develop an asynchronous order processing system to handle real-time order data efficiently.	
Scope: The system should be able to receive millions of orders in real time, 
confirm receipt to the sender application, and process the orders in the database sequentially.	

"1. Order Receiving Module:

. Must receive order data in real time. (Done)
. Should send a confirmation back to the sender once the order is received." (Done)
"2. Messaging Queue Integration (Apache Kafka):

. Implement Kafka producers to send order data to a Kafka topic. (Done)

. Ensure the system can handle high throughput (millions of orders)."	(Run more for this file receive_order.py)

"3. Order Processing Module:

. Develop Kafka consumers to process orders from the Kafka topic. (Done)
. Orders should be processed and stored in the database sequentially. (Done)
. Ensure reliable processing (handling of failures, retries)."(Done)
